# Chingu Solo Project - Flutter - Tier 2 - News API

![Design](assets/design.png)

## Overview

This project helps you gain experience in using API's to enhance the value
your applications provide to their users. Your objective with this project is 
to build a mobile application with Flutter using the News API to receive latest news and show them to your users.

## Instructions

General instructions for all Solo Projects are located in the 
[Chingu Library](https://voyage.docs.chingu.io/prework/howwork). For detailed 
requirements, please checkout the following.

### For Beginners in Dart and Flutter

The primary programming language in Flutter is Dart. Dart is a programming language from Google primarily focused on performance and UI design, so it is perfect for Flutter development. If you have never worked with Dart, I would recommend to start with the [first Tier](https://github.com/md-weber/soloproject-tier1-flutter-projectname) of the Flutter projects. But if you feel ready here are some ressources that can help you.

  - Use a Futurebuilder to receive the information
  - Find a way to reload the articles
  
#### Style

- [ ] You may use any style you choose. However, it should be consistent (e.g.
